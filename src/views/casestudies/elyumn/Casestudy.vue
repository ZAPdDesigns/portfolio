				<p class="p">Elyumn is an upcoming platform that allows creatives, such as designers, artists, photographers, videographer, and more, to create a portfolio site and/or store within minutes, at extremely low rates for hosting.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Design Process</h2>
				<p class="p">When starting this project, I wanted the brand to feel as if there is some excitement to it, while at the same time keeping the overall concept very simple and straight to the point. Since the platform offers users to host their work on their own site with Elyumn, we wanted the mark to represent items of the sort, like elements that make up a whole.</p>
				<p class="p">I played with many concepts of the mark and many different variants and landed on a select few that fit the personality I am trying to invoke in the brand. I also explored some color variants that could also fit the personality I am trying to achieve. Not only did I want something that was exciting, I also wanted the brand to feel more playful and approachable for all people of all ages wanting to use the platform.</p>

				<p class="p">Elyumn is an online platform targeted towards creatives wanting to have a place for their work to be shown off. Because of this, the  behind the structure of the mark is quite simple: professionalism is key. Having a very structured, grid-based mark allows for the view to see how the strategically placed circles represent how their own work will be displayed on their site through Elyumn.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Typography</h2>
				<p class="p">Elyumn is a forward-thinking platform that wants to offer creatives a more accessible way to show their work professionally. The typeface Aileron fit quite well with the brand, as it expresses professionalism, simplicity, and a bit of playfulness to invoke more friendly tones. The chosen typeface too contributes to the logo's approachableness and plays elegantly with the mark</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Marketing</h2>
				<p class="p">Currently, Elyumn is still in the works and will, in the future, have more marketing materials for their brand. One of the main taglines that is intriguing is "Give your work a place to live." Through this tagline, it represents what Elyumn is in a single, short statement. Through future marketing assets, the circle pattern will be featured and will incorporate artwork and designs of creators to express the potential someone has when using the platform for their own work.</p>
