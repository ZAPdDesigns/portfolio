				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">What is Concur App?</h2>
				<p class="p">Concur App is a new app that is targeted towards the esports industry that allowed competitive teams, both amateur and professional, to create plays for games to organize team plans during games. All competitive games are expected to be on the platform to aids teams before and in-game.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">My Role</h2>
				<p class="p">I was offered to brand the new platform that is emerging in esports that will be targeted towards professional competitive teams in the $1.1 billion esports industry. From the logo to marketing material, I was set out to develop a brand that is tailored to professional teams who will use the app in their competitive matches.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Needs</h2>
				<p class="p">Concur App needed features that allowed team members and managers to quickly plan out plays for matches and games so teammates know exactly what to do to have a greater chance of winning the game. These features include a drawing board, and messaging system, and a way to export these drawn plays to share. The drawing board is a real-time canvas that allows whomever has access to the team to see plays drawn out in real time. This is essential to demonstrate to teammates how they should make their moves within a game.</p>
				<p class="p"> The brand needed to represent who the app was and how we might assist teams in games to improve their gameplay and win rate.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Solution</h2>
				<p class="p">After several iterations of concepts, we finally settled on the shown mark. It represents how teams should be determined to win games and make their team number one, and how the logo points to the center of itself to express the targets often placed on the drawing board that represent destination that teammates strive to get to. The typeface is a proprietary typeface that was made to play nicely with the orange target mark. This gives the overall concept a sleeker look, which is the aesthetic that is targeted towards the gaming industry.</p>
