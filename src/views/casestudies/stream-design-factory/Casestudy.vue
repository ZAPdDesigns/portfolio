				<p class="p">The Stream Design Factory, developed by Visuals by Impulse, is a Streamlabs OBS app that gives streamers unlimited access to a collection of premium Twitch overlays, animations, and graphics to use in their stream right out of the box.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">My Role</h2>
				<p class="p">Before working on this project, I was heavily invested into Visual by Impulses portal and design system. I was offered to start designing the experience for the Stream Design Factory, which about 33% of users on the Streamlabs OBS platform using the app store are currently using the app. When the development started for the project, their wasn't much time to structure the design system properly. When I was brought onto the project, my role was to fix all of these design issues and streamline the entire app to make the overall experience more enjoyable.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Needs</h2>
				<p class="p">Since most of the features were implemented into the app when I joined the project, I needed to redesign every feature and streamline the entire design system so that it would better reflect the design system of Streamlabs itself. The entire Streamlabs design system needed to be reformatted so that we could prototype the app within Figma.</p>

				<h2 class="casestudy-section-title">Solution</h2>
				<p class="p">After the design system conversion and getting everything structured how we wanted it, the views were created based on what was already established but was greatly improved upon. The design shown can be seen in the actual app on the Streamlabs OBS app store.</p>
