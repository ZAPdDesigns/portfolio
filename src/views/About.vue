			<h2>Hi, I'm Will.</h2>
			<p>I'm from Central Kentucky, currently living in Nashville, Tennessee. I love working on various design projects, whether it be creating brands or designing sites and apps. I've been designing and playing with code since I was twelve. While I listen to a lot of music, I spend most of my time at my desk working on personal projects and other various projects.</p>
			<p>I am currently a web designer at Visuals by Impulse, a remote-based design studio who has worked with thousands of streamers big and small. I create experiences for VBI's staff, front-facing clients, and anyone who uses VBI's products, whether it be the portal or the new Stream Design Factory app on the Streamlabs OBS app store.</p>
